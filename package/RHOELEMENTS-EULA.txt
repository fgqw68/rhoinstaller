This is a legal agreement between Symbol Technologies, Inc. (“Symbol”), and Licensee (an end user that is either an individual or a legal entity, or an authorized Symbol reseller, hereafter referred to as “you” or “Licensee”) for the Licensed Software (as defined below).  This Licensed Software is not open source software and this is not an open source license.

1.         Definitions. 
For purposes of this Agreement, the terms provided below shall have the following meaning:
1.1  "Software" refers to the RhoStudio software available for download to you.  
1.2  "Documentation" refers to electronic or printed manuals and accompanying instructional aides licensed to you. 
1.3  "Product(s)" refers to the specific combination of Software and Documentation that you have licensed and which has been provided to you under the terms of this Agreement.  
1.4  “Licensee Applications” shall mean an application program that runs on a mobile device.   
1.5  “Device” shall mean a specific physical mobile device.  

2.         License Grant.
Provided that you ("Licensee" or "you") comply with the Conditions of Use set forth in Section 3 below, Symbol grants you a personal, nonexclusive, nontransferable license to use the Products to create Licensee Applications.  If Licensee decides to use the RhoConnect and/or RhoElements features, it must comply with the terms and conditions of the Rho Software License Agreement (per Device, Continuous) (including the payment obligations of Section 4.2 of that agreement) prior to supporting Devices that incorporate Licensee Applications.  Any terms or conditions appearing on the face or reverse side of any purchase order, purchase order acknowledgment or other order documents that are different from, or in addition to, the terms of this Agreement will not be binding on the parties, even if payment is accepted. 

3.         Conditions of Use.

3.1      Any use of the Products outside of the conditions set forth herein is strictly prohibited and will be deemed a breach of this Agreement.

3.2        Only your employees or agents may use the Products.  You shall take all necessary steps to insure that your employees and agents abide by the terms of this Agreement.

3.3        You shall use the Products (i) only for your internal business purposes; (ii) only as described in the Products; and (iii) in strict accordance with this Agreement.

3.4        Licensee may install and use the Products on a single client workstation, provided that the use is in conformance with the terms set forth in this Agreement.  The unmodified Products may not be transferred to another party without the express written consent of Symbol, regardless of whether or not such transfer is accomplished by physical or electronic means.

3.5       Portions of the Products are protected by United States copyright laws, international treaty provisions, and other applicable laws.  Therefore, you must treat the Products like any other copyrighted material (e.g., a book or musical recording) except that you may either: (i) make 1 copy of the transportable part of the Products (which typically is supplied on diskette, CD-ROM, or downloadable internet), solely for back-up purposes; or (ii) copy the transportable part of the Products to a PC hard disk, provided you keep the original solely for back-up purposes.  If the Documentation is in printed form, it may not be copied.  If the Documentation is in electronic form, you may print out 1 copy, which then may not be copied.  With regard to the copy made for backup or archival purposes, you agree to reproduce any Symbol copyright notice, and other proprietary legends appearing thereon.  Such copyright notice(s) may appear in any of several forms, including machine-readable form, and you agree to reproduce such notice in each form in which it appears, to the extent it is physically possible to do so.  Unauthorized duplication of the Software or Documentation constitutes copyright infringement, and in the United States is punishable in federal court by fine and imprisonment. 

3.6        Licensee shall not distribute, sublicense, rent, loan, lease, export, re-export, resell, ship or divert or cause to be exported, re-exported, resold, shipped or diverted, directly or indirectly, the unmodified Products under this Agreement.

3.7     Licensee grants Symbol the right, which Symbol will exercise at its own expense and no more than once per year, to enter Licensee’s premises during business hours for the sole purpose of examining Licensee’s records and other information relating to the Licensee’s use of the Products. If this examination reveals that Licensee has underpaid fees or improperly used the Products, Symbol shall invoice Licensee for such unauthorized use based upon Symbol’s standard fees in effect at the time the examination is completed.  If the underpaid fees exceed five percent (5%) of the fees actually paid, then Licensee shall also pay Symbol’s reasonable costs of conducting the examination.

4.         Ownership. 
Title to all copies of Software will not pass to Licensee at any time and remains vested exclusively in Symbol.  Symbol owns and retains all of its proprietary rights in any form concerning the Software and Documentation, including all rights in patents, patent applications, inventions, copyrights, trade secrets, trademarks, trade names, and other intellectual properties (including any corrections, bug fixes, enhancements, updates, or modifications to or derivative works from the Software whether made by Symbol or another party, or any improvements that result from Symbol’s processes or, if applicable, providing information services).  Nothing in this Agreement is intended to restrict the proprietary rights of Symbol or to grant by implication or estoppel any proprietary rights.  All intellectual property developed, originated, or prepared by Symbol in connection with providing to Licensee Software, Products, Documentation, or related services remain vested exclusively in Symbol, and this Agreement does not grant to Licensee any shared development rights of intellectual property. 

4.1        If you transfer possession of any copy of the Products to another party outside of the terms of this agreement, your license is automatically terminated.  Title and copyrights to the Products and any copies made by you remain with Symbol and its licensors.  You shall not, and shall not permit others to: (i) modify, translate, decompile, bootleg, reverse engineer, disassemble, or extract the inner workings of the Software or Documentation, (ii) copy the look-and-feel or functionality of the Software or Documentation; (iii) remove any proprietary notices, marks, labels, or logos from the Software or Documentation; (iv) rent or transfer all or some of the Software or Documentation to any other party without Symbol’s prior written consent; or (v) utilize any computer software or hardware which is designed to defeat any copy protection device, should the Products be equipped with such a protection device.  If the Products contain Software or Documentation that is provided on multiple types of media (such as diskette, CD-ROM, downloadable internet), then you shall only use the medium which best meets your specific needs, and shall not loan, rent, lease, or transfer the other media contained in the package without Symbol’s written consent.  Unauthorized copying of the Software or Documentation, or failure to comply with any of the provisions of this Agreement, will result in automatic termination of this license.   

5.         Confidentiality. 
You acknowledge that all Products contain valuable proprietary information and trade secrets and that unauthorized or improper use of the Products will result in irreparable harm to Symbol for which monetary damages would be inadequate and for which Symbol will be entitled to immediate injunctive relief.  Accordingly, you will limit access to the Products to those of your employees and agents who need to use the Products for your internal business purposes, and you will take appropriate action with those employees and agents to preserve the confidentiality of the Products, using the same degree of care to avoid unauthorized or improper disclosure as you use for the protection of your own proprietary software, but in no event less than reasonable care. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary herein, you shall have no obligation to preserve the confidentiality of any proprietary information that: (i) was in the public domain at the time of disclosure; (ii) entered the public domain through no fault of yours; (iii) was given to you free of any obligation to keep it confidential; (iv) is independently developed by you; or (v) is disclosed as required by law provided that you notify Symbol prior to such disclosure and provide Symbol with a reasonable opportunity to respond.

6.         Right to Use Symbol’s Name. 
Except as required in Section 3.5 above, you shall not, during the term of this Agreement or thereafter, use any trademark, of Motorola Solutions or Symbol, or any word or symbol likely to be confused with any Motorola Solutions or Symbol trademark, either alone or in any combination with another word or words.

7.         Maintenance. 
Symbol shall not be responsible for maintenance or field service of the Software under this Agreement.

8.        PATENT Indemnification; Limited warranty and warranty disclaimer.

8.1        Symbol shall indemnify Licensee by defending, at its expense, any claim, and any lawsuit to the extent based thereon, that is brought against Licensee alleging that the Product, as originally delivered by Symbol to Licensee under this Agreement, directly infringes a patent or copyright registered in the country in which Symbol originally sold the Product to Licensee ("Infringement Claim"), so long as Symbol is notified in writing by Licensee as soon as reasonably practicable as to any such claim, but in no event after Symbol would be prejudiced by a lack of such notice, is given sole authority and control of the defense, and is provided by Licensee all requested information and assistance for resolving or defending the Infringement Claim.  In addition to Symbol’s obligation to defend, and subject to the same conditions, Symbol shall pay all damages finally awarded against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent based upon such Infringement Claim, or agreed to in writing by Symbol in settlement of the Infringement Claim.  If the Product is subject to an Infringement Claim or, if in Symbol’s judgment, likely to become subject to a Infringement Claim, in addition to its obligation to defend and pay damages, Symbol, in its sole discretion, shall: (a) obtain a license for Licensee to continue to use or to sell the Product purchased from Symbol; (b) replace or modify the Product so as to be substantially functionally equivalent but non-infringing; or (c) require the return of the Product and credit the fair market value of the Product less a reasonable charge for depreciation calculated on a three (3) year straight line depreciation basis.  Symbol shall have no liability to Licensee for any alleged or actual infringement, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with Licensee’s use or transfer of the Product after Symbol’s written notice to Licensee that Licensee shall cease use or transfer of such Product. Symbol shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify Licensee under this agreement  for any damages based upon a per-use royalty or the Licensee’s revenues, or upon any damages theory other than a reasonable royalty applied to, or lost profits of the patent owner based on, the purchase price paid by Licensee to Symbol for the infringing Product.  Symbol shall have no obligation to defend or indemnify Licensee under this agreement for any alleged or actual infringement arising out of (a) use of Product in connection or in combination with equipment, devices or Product not provided by Symbol; (b) use of the Product in a manner for which they were not designed;  (c) any modification of the Product by anyone other than Symbol; (d) compliance with Licensee’s designs, specifications, guidelines or instructions; (e) compliance with a standard issued by any public or private standards body; or (f) any assertion by a non-practicing entity which maintains no significant manufacturing capability ((a) – (d) defined as “Excluded Conduct”).  Licensee shall indemnify
Symbol against any claim of infringement that is brought against Symbol based upon or arising out of such Excluded Conduct or arising out of Licensee’s continued use or transfer of the Product after being noticed to cease such use or transfer.  Symbol shall not be responsible for any compromise or settlement made by Licensee without Symbol’s prior written consent.  THIS SECTION PROVIDES LICENSEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND SYMBOL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.  LICENSEE HAS NO RIGHT TO RECOVER AND SYMBOL HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE ANY OTHER OR FURTHER REMEDIES, WHETHER UNDER ANOTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR PRINCIPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.

8.2        Limited Warranty.  All diskettes or CD-ROMS on which the Products are furnished ("Media") are warranted to be free from manufacturing and material defects for 90 days after the shipment date of the Products to you.  Media that becomes defective during such period will be repaired or, at Symbol’s option, replaced.  This limited warranty is contingent upon proper use of the Media and does not cover Products which have been tampered with, modified, or subjected to unusual physical or electrical stress.  Tampering with or removal of any factory seal or label on any Media voids this warranty and releases Symbol from any and all liability.

8.3        Disclaimer.   EXCEPT FOR THE ABOVE EXPRESS LIMITED WARRANTY, SYMBOL MAKES, AND YOU RECEIVE, NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, WHETHER EXPRESS, IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR IN ANY COMMUNICATION WITH YOU.  SYMBOL SPECIFICALLY DISCLAIMS ANY WARRANTY INCLUDING THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILTY, NONINFRINGEMENT, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE PRODUCTS ARE PROVIDED "AS IS." SYMBOL DOES NOT WARRANT THAT THE SOFTWARE WILL MEET YOUR REQUIREMENTS, OR THAT THE OPERATION OF THE SOFTWARE WILL BE UNINTERRUPTED OR ERROR FREE, OR THAT DEFECTS IN THE SOFTWARE WILL BE CORRECTED.  SYMBOL MAKES NO WARRANTY WITH RESPECT TO THE CORRECTNESS, ACCURACY, OR RELIABILITY OF THE SOFTWARE AND DOCUMENTATION.  Some jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion of implied warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you.

8.4        Remedies.  The entire liability of Symbol, and your exclusive remedy under the warranty provided herein will be, at Symbol’s option, to repair or replace any Media found to be defective within the warranty period, or to refund the purchase price and terminate this Agreement.  To seek such a remedy, you must return the entire Product to Symbol, with a copy of the original purchase receipt, within the warranty period.

9.        Limitation of Liability.  
TO THE MAXIMUM EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW, SYMBOL AND ITS LICENSORS WILL NOT BE LIABLE WITH RESPECT TO ANY SUBJECT MATTER OF THIS AGREEMENT UNDER ANY CONTRACT, NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, OR OTHER LEGAL OR EQUITABLE THEORY FOR (I) ANY AMOUNTS IN EXCESS IN THE AGGREGATE OF THE AMOUNTS YOU PAID FOR THE LICENSED SOFTWARE; (II) ANY LOST DATA OR OTHER EXEMPLARY, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOOD WILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, LOSS OF DATA, OR ANY AND ALL LOST PROFITS, EVEN IF SYMBOL HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES; OR (III) THE COST OF PROCURING SUBSTITUTE GOODS,SERVICES OR TECHNOLOGY. THE LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SET FORTH IN THIS SECTION SHALL NOT APPLY TO THE EXTENT PROHIBITED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  

10.        High Risk Activities
The Products are not fault-tolerant and are not designed, manufactured or intended for use or resale as on-line control software in hazardous environments requiring fail-safe performance, such as in the operation of nuclear facilities, aircraft navigation or communication systems, air traffic control, direct life support machines, or weapons systems, in which the failure of the Products could lead directly to death, personal injury, or severe physical or environmental damage ("High Risk Activities").  Symbol and its suppliers specifically disclaim any express or implied warranty of fitness for High Risk Activities, and if you elect to use the Products in any High Risk Activities, you agree to indemnify, defend, and hold Symbol harmless from and against any and all costs, damages, and losses related to that use.

11.        U.S. Government
If you are acquiring the Products on behalf of any unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the following shall apply.  Use, duplication, or disclosure of the Products is subject to the restrictions set forth in subparagraphs (c) (1) and (2) of the Commercial Computer Software - Restricted Rights clause at FAR 52.227-19 (JUNE 1987), if applicable, unless being provided to the Department of Defense.  If being provided to the Department of Defense, use, duplication, or disclosure of the Products is subject to the restricted rights set forth in subparagraph (c) (1) (ii) of the Rights in Technical Data and Computer Software clause at DFARS 252.227-7013 (OCT 1988), if applicable.  Software and Documentation may or may not include a Restricted Rights notice, or other notice referring specifically to the terms and conditions of this Agreement.  The terms and conditions of this Agreement shall each continue to apply, but only to the extent that such terms and conditions are not inconsistent with the rights provided to you under the aforementioned provisions of the FAR and DFARS, as applicable to the particular procuring agency and procurement transaction.

12.        Term of License

12.1     Your right to use the Products will begin when you click the "ACCEPT" button below, which constitutes acceptance of the terms and conditions herein, and will continue in perpetuity unless terminated as follows.   Your right to use the Products will terminate immediately without notice upon a breach of this Agreement by you.  Otherwise, this Agreement may be terminated by either party upon 30 days prior written notice.  Within 30 days after termination of this Agreement, you will certify to Symbol in writing that through your best efforts, and to the best of your knowledge, the original and all copies, in whole or in part, in any form, of the Software and all related material and Documentation, have been destroyed, except that, with prior written consent from Symbol, you may retain one copy for archival or backup purposes.   You may not sublicense, assign or transfer the license or the Products, except as expressly provided in this Agreement.  Any attempt to otherwise sublicense, assign or transfer any of the rights, duties or obligations hereunder is null and void.

12.2     Licensee acknowledges that Symbol has made a considerable investment of resources in the development, marketing, and distribution of its proprietary Software and Documentation and that reasonable and appropriate limitations on Licensee’s use of the Software and Documentation are necessary for Symbol to protect its investment, trade secrets, and valuable intellectual property rights concerning the Software and Documentation.  Licensee also acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to Symbol for which monetary damages would be inadequate. In the event of a breach of this Agreement and in addition to termination of this Agreement, Symbol will be entitled to all available remedies at law or in equity (including immediate injunctive relief and repossession of all non-embedded Software and associated Documentation unless Licensee is a Federal agency of the United States Government).  Within thirty (30) days after termination of this Agreement, Licensee must certify in writing to Symbol that all copies of the Software and Documentation have been returned to Symbol or destroyed and are no longer in use by Licensee.

13.        Governing Law. 
This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the United States of America to the extent that they apply and otherwise by the laws of the State of New York without regard to its conflict of laws provisions.

14.        Assignment. 
This Agreement may not be assigned or otherwise transferred by you.

15.        Survival of Provisions. 
The parties agree that where the context of any provision indicates an intent that it shall survive the term of this Agreement, then it shall survive.

16.        Entire Agreement. 
This Agreement contains the parties’ entire agreement regarding your use of the Products and may be amended only in writing signed by both parties, except that Symbol may modify this Agreement as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations including FCC regulations.

17.        Compliance with Laws. 
Licensee will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export laws and regulations of the United States.  Licensee will not, without the prior authorization of Symbol and the appropriate governmental authority of the United States, in any form export or re-export, sell or resell, ship or reship, or divert, through direct or indirect means, any item or technical data or direct or indirect products sold or otherwise furnished to any person within any territory for which the United States Government or any of its agencies at the time of the action, requires an export license or other governmental approval.  Violation of this provision will be a material breach of this Agreement, permitting immediate termination by Symbol.

18.        Waivers. 
Failure or delay by either party to exercise a right or power under this Agreement will not be a waiver of the right or power.  For a waiver of a right or power to be effective, it must be in writing signed by the waiving party.  An effective waiver of a right or power will not be construed as either a future or continuing waiver of that same right or power,
or the waiver of any other right or power.

19.        Assignments and Subcontracting. 
Symbol may assign any of its rights or subcontract any of its obligations under this Agreement, or encumber or sell any of its rights in any Software, without prior notice to or consent of Licensee.

20.        Entire Agreement and Amendment. 
This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement of the parties regarding Licensee’s use of the Software and Documentation and may be amended or modified only by a written instrument signed by an authorized representative of each party, except that Symbol may modify this Agreement as necessary to comply with applicable laws and regulations.  This Agreement will be fairly interpreted in accordance with its terms and conditions and not for or against either party.

21.        Severability. 
If a court of competent jurisdiction renders any part of this Agreement to be invalid or unenforceable, that part will be severed and the remainder of this Agreement will continue in full force and effect.

22.        Third Party Software.
The Software may contain one or more items of third-party software supplied by other third-party suppliers.  The terms of this Agreement govern your use of any third-party software UNLESS A SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE LICENSE IS INCLUDED, IN WHICH CASE YOUR USE OF THE THIRD-PARTY SOFTWARE WILL THEN BE GOVERNED BY THE SEPARATE THIRD-PARTY LICENSE.  Unless otherwise specifically stated herein, Symbol makes no representations or warranties of any kind regarding third party software.


The Software may contain one or more items of Third-Party Software supplied by other third-party suppliers. The terms of this Agreement or any accompanying third party license agreements shall govern your use of any Third-Party Software.

Section 5    PATENT INFRINGEMENT INDEMNIFICATION, LIMITED WARRANTY AND WARRANTY DISCLAIMER

        Patent Infringement Indemnification.

            Symbol shall defend Licensee against any claim, and any lawsuit to the extent based thereon, that is brought against Licensee alleging that the Licensed Software, as originally delivered by Symbol to Licensee under this Agreement, directly infringes a United States patent in existence as of the date of delivery of such Licensed Software to Licensee ("Infringement Claim"), so long as Symbol is notified in writing by Licensee as soon as reasonably practicable as to any such claim, is given sole authority and control of the defense, and is provided by Licensee all requested information and assistance for resolving or defending the Infringement Claim.  For non-Symbol-branded software or Licensed Software supplied hereunder, including any third party software, Symbol’s obligations for intellectual property infringement claims shall be limited to any intellectual property indemnities or defense commitments provided by such third party supplier.  In addition to Symbol's obligation to defend, and subject to the same conditions, Symbol shall pay all damages finally awarded against Licensee by a court of competent jurisdiction to the extent based upon such Infringement Claim.  If a Licensed Software is subject to an Infringement Claim or, if in Symbol’s judgment, likely to become subject to a Infringement Claim, Symbol’s obligations under this Section shall be fulfilled if at any time Symbol, in its sole discretion, shall: (x) obtain a license for Licensee to continue to use or to sell the Licensed Software purchased from Symbol; (y) replace or modify the Licensed Software so as to be substantially functionally equivalent but non-infringing; or (z) refund the purchase price paid to Symbol by Licensee for such Licensed Software less a reasonable charge for straight line depreciation and/or prior use.  Symbol shall have no liability to Licensee for any alleged or actual infringement, or otherwise, arising out of or in connection with Licensee’s ordering, use or transfer of Licensed Software after Symbol’s notice to Licensee that Licensee shall cease use or transfer of such Licensed Software.

            Symbol shall have no liability to Licensee under this Agreement (i) for any damages based upon a per-use royalty or the Licensee’s revenues, or upon any damages theory other than a reasonable royalty applied to, or lost profits of the patent owner based on, the purchase price paid by Licensee to Symbol for the infringing Licensed Software; or (ii) for any alleged or actual infringement arising out of (a) use of Licensed Software in connection or in combination with equipment, devices or software not provided by Symbol, (b) use of Licensed Software in a manner for which they were not designed, (c) any modification of Licensed Software by anyone other than Symbol, (d) compliance with Licensee's designs, specifications, guidelines or instructions; or (e) use of the Licensed Software in a patented process ((a) – (e) defined as “Excluded Conduct”).  Licensee shall indemnify Symbol against any claim of infringement that is brought against Symbol based upon or arising out of such Excluded Conduct or arising out of Licensee’s continued use or transfer of Licensed Software after being noticed to cease such use or transfer.  Symbol shall not be responsible for any compromise or settlement made by Licensee without Symbol’s prior written consent.  

            THIS SECTION PROVIDES LICENSEE’S SOLE AND EXCLUSIVE REMEDIES AND SYMBOL’S ENTIRE LIABILITY IN THE EVENT OF AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.  LICENSEE HAS NO RIGHT TO RECOVER AND SYMBOL HAS NO OBLIGATION TO PROVIDE ANY OTHER OR FURTHER REMEDIES, WHETHER UNDER ANOTHER PROVISION OF THIS AGREEMENT OR ANY OTHER LEGAL THEORY OR PRINCIPLE, IN CONNECTION WITH AN INFRINGEMENT CLAIM.  IN ADDITION, THE RIGHTS AND REMEDIES PROVIDED IN THIS SECTION ARE SUBJECT TO AND LIMITED BY THE RESTRICTIONS SET FORTH IN THE GENERAL LIMIT OF LIABILITY SECTION OF THIS AGREEMENT.  IN NO EVENT SHALL SYMBOL BE LIABLE FOR ANY SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, INDIRECT, COLLATERAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES OR LOST PROFITS OF LICENSEE IN CONNECTION WITH ANY CLAIMS, LOSSES, DAMAGES OR INJURIES UNDER THIS SECTION.  In no event shall Symbol’s liability under this Section exceed the total net sales to Licensee of the applicable Licensed Software.

        Limited Warranty and Warranty Disclaimer

Symbol warrants to Licensee for a period of ninety (90) days from the date of Licensee’s receipt of the Licensed Software (the “Warranty Period”) that the Licensed Software as delivered will conform substantially to Symbol’s then-current published functional specifications set forth in the documentation for the Licensed Software when installed and operated as contemplated in such documentation. In the event of any nonconformity, Symbol (or its designee) may, in its sole discretion, either (i) remedy the nonconformity within a reasonable period after notice and verification thereof or (ii) refund the amount Licensee paid for the Software and terminate this Agreement and the license granted herein; provided, however, that Licensee must return the original and all copies of the Licensed Software to Symbol or its authorized representative before Licensee will be entitled to receive any such refund. THIS SECTION 5 STATES LICENSEE’S SOLE REMEDY FOR A BREACH OF THE LIMITED WARRANTY OF THE LICENSED SOFTWARE.

8.7 Irreparable Harm

Licensee acknowledges that Symbol has made a considerable investment of resources in the development, marketing, and distribution of its proprietary Software and Documentation and that reasonable and appropriate limitations on Licensee’s use of the Software and Documentation are necessary for Symbol to protect its investment, trade secrets, and valuable intellectual property rights concerning the Software and Documentation.  Licensee also acknowledges that its breach of this Agreement will result in irreparable harm to Symbol for which monetary damages would be inadequate. In the event of a breach of this Agreement and in addition to termination of this Agreement, Symbol will be entitled to all available remedies at law or in equity (including immediate injunctive relief and repossession of all non-embedded Software and associated Documentation unless Licensee is a Federal agency of the United States Government). 

8.8 Right to Audit

Licensee shall retain for a period of five (5) years after receiving an invoice from Symbol, the records, files, and books of account prepared in the normal course of business, which contain data reasonably required for the computation and verification of the amounts to be paid under this Agreement. No more often than once per year, Licensee shall permit the inspection, with reasonable advance notice and at reasonable times during normal business hours, of such records, files, and books of account by an independent accountant (“Auditor”). Said Auditor shall be permitted to inspect such records, files, and books and Licensee shall give said Auditor such other information as may be necessary and proper to enable the amounts of payments payable hereunder to be accurately ascertained. Such inspection shall be at Symbol's expense unless it is determined by said Auditor that the royalties paid to Symbol are deficient in excess of five percent (5%), in which case such inspection shall be paid for by Licensee, and Licensee, in addition to any other remedy provided Symbol by law or by this Agreement, agrees and is hereby bound to pay Symbol an amount equal to one hundred twenty-five percent (125%) of that which Licensee has failed to report or pay to compensate Symbol for its internal costs and interest due to delayed payment in connection with the inspection.  Any payments due under this Section shall be due immediately following notice from Symbol of such deficiency or failure to report.

8.9 Governing Law and Legal Venue

This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the federal laws of the United States of America and the internal laws of the State of New York without giving effect to any choice of law rule that would result in the application of the laws of any other jurisdiction. The United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods (CISG) shall not apply. Each Party (a) hereby irrevocably submits itself to and consents to the jurisdiction of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York (or if such court lacks jurisdiction, the state courts of the State of New York) for the purposes of any action, claim, suit or proceeding between the Parties in connection with any controversy, claim, or dispute arising out of or relating to this Agreement; and (b) hereby waives, and agrees not to assert by way of motion, as a defense or otherwise, in any such action, claim, suit or proceeding, any claim that is not personally subject to the jurisdiction of such court(s), that the action, claim, suit or proceeding is brought in an inconvenient forum or that the venue of the action, claim, suit or proceeding is improper.

8.10 Assignment by Symbol

Symbol may assign this Agreement to any of its affiliates, and may assign its right to receive payment under this Agreement without the prior written consent of the Licensee.  In addition, for any Symbol divestiture, sale or other similar transaction (whether by way of merger, asset sale, stock sale, spin-off or otherwise) (each a “Sale”), Symbol may, without the prior written consent of Licensee and at no additional cost to Symbol or to the assignee entity(ies), assign its rights and obligations under this Agreement, in whole or in part, to the assignee entity(ies).

8.11 Compliance with Laws

Licensee will comply with all applicable laws and regulations, including export laws and regulations of the United States.  Licensee will not, without the prior authorization of Licensor and the appropriate governmental authority of the United States, in any form export or re-export, sell or resell, ship or reship, or divert, through direct or indirect means, any item or technical data or direct or indirect products sold or otherwise furnished to any person within any territory for which the United States Government or any of its agencies at the time of the action, requires an export license or other governmental approval.  Violation of this provision will be a material breach of this Agreement, permitting immediate termination by Licensor.

8.12 Waivers

Failure or delay by Licensor to exercise a right or power under this Agreement will not be a waiver of the right or power.  For a waiver of a right or power to be effective, it must be in writing signed by the Licensor.  An effective waiver of a right or power will not be construed as either a future or continuing waiver of that same right or power, or the waiver of any other right or power.
